# Diagnostic Medicare Center Management System


A Diagnostic Medicare Center Management System (DMS), is a system used for maintaining the details of the "Diagnostic Medicare System". It provides several operations booking an apointment, creating an account for the customer who wants to be a member of the Diagnostic center, to search for a Medicare service, to apply for any health checkup, to find a medical insurance agent and services and to view the medical reports online.

The following are the few important modules in the system:  
a.	To create an account for the new customer   
b.	To search for any Medicare service.  
c.	 Apply for any health checkup   
d.	To find an medical Insurance agent and services  
e.	To view the medical report online.

## 🔧 1. ❓ What is the Problem?
In many healthcare environments, especially diagnostic centers and clinics, the process of managing health checkup applications, user records, and test scheduling is still manual or semi-automated. This leads to:

- Inefficiencies in handling patient data and appointments.
- Delays in processing health checkup applications.
- Errors in record-keeping and communication.
- Lack of transparency for patients regarding their application status or test results.


# 🎯 Motivation Behind Building It
The goal is to digitize and streamline the diagnostic process by creating a centralized system that:

  - Allows users to apply for health checkups online.
  - Enables diagnostic centers to manage applications, users, and test packages efficiently.
  - Reduces administrative overhead and improves accuracy.
  - Provides real-time status updates to users.
  - Enhances data security and accessibility.
    
*This system is especially valuable in the post-pandemic world, where contactless and remote healthcare services are increasingly important.

## 🧱 2. System Architecture Overview
- 🧱 Diagram Explanation
  - 🗄️ Database Entities
  - AppUser: Represents users of the system.
  - HealthCheckup: Represents available health checkup packages.
  - CustomerHealthCheckupApplication: Central entity that links users to checkups.
  - Relationships:
     - CustomerHealthCheckupApplication → AppUser: Many-to-One
     -  CustomerHealthCheckupApplication → HealthCheckup: Many-to-One

       This mapping results in a structure like: 

      Table: user_health_checkup_application 
      ----------------------------------------------------- 
      | id | application_date | status | appUser_id | health_checkup_id | 
      ----------------------------------------------------- 
       
      
      appUser_id → Foreign key to AppUser table
